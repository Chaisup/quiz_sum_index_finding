## Sum Index Finding
My Solution for the Quiz of KKP Dime! Data Engineer Application


### About
An algorithm problem to find the sum index (m,n) from a sorted number list that sum=target.
If we use a brute force method, it may take a longer time with O(nÂ²).
So, this workshop will demonstrate an improved method with O(n) instead.


### Solution
Please see the logic in the .py file and a test run result in the .txt file.
